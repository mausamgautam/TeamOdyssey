That is to say, both households and insurance companies will want to know if there is any area which is of a high risk of flooding bordering the zone in question.  For this reason, I have chosen to continue with k=3, but it is a subjective choice.  \nA more rigorous approach would take in the following two additions:\nFirstly, in areas where little assessment has been done, any data from the nearest neighbours would be rejected if these are more than 'a' miles away from the postcode in question.  This may result in a prediction not being possible for some postcodes.\nSecondly, it would be wise to bring in altitude data for the postcodes in question.  Ideally this would compare the lowest altitude of the postcode in question with that of its nieghbours (if this were not available then the mean altitude would still bring something helpful to the model).  I suggest that a correction factor of 1 band Up or down, as appropriate, might be applied to the prediction if the postcode is more than 'b' meters different in altitude from its neighbours.\nSuitable values of 'a' and 'b' would need to be determined by the Environment Agency.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Remind ourselves what we have:\nassessed_feat #
